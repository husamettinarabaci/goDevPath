# Levels

## 1. The Gopher Initiate
**Foundations: Syntax, Variables, Functions, Types, and Control Flow**  
Build the essential foundation in Go. Learn type system, variables, functions, control flow, and how to write idiomatic Go code.

## 2. Certified Gopher
**Intermediate Go: Structs, Interfaces, Error Handling, JSON, Modules**  
Build on your Go foundation. Master structs, interfaces, error handling, JSON, modules, and the standard library for real-world Go development.

## 3. Applied Go Builder
**Applied Go: Web Servers, CLI Tools, gRPC, Game Dev, Embedded, Plugins**  
Apply Go in practical scenarios: build RESTful APIs, develop command-line tools with Cobra, create games with Ebiten, write gRPC services, run Go on microcontrollers, and implement plugin systems.

## 4. Go Core Alchemist
**Deep Go: Memory Model, Escape Analysis, Reflection, Unsafe, Build Tags**  
Understand Go’s inner workings: analyze memory allocations, leverage reflection, explore unsafe operations, use build constraints, and inspect runtime behavior.

## 5. Concurrency Commander
**Concurrency Mastery: Channels, Goroutines, Fan-In/Fan-Out, Timeout Patterns**  
Master Go’s concurrency paradigm: coordinate goroutines using channels, implement fan-in/fan-out patterns, handle timeouts, avoid deadlocks, and detect race conditions.

## 6. Architect of Go Realms
**Architectural Go: Microservices, Monoliths, Event-Driven Systems, Pipelines**  
Design robust applications: build scalable microservices, monolithic apps with layered structure, event-driven communication, data streaming pipelines, and cross-service observability.
