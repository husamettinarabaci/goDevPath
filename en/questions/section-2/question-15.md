#### ❓ Question 15: Type inference in variable declarations

Write a Go program that demonstrates type inference when declaring variables.

- Declare variables without explicitly specifying their types.
- Assign values to the variables.
- Print the variables and their types to the terminal.

🔧 **Task:** Show how Go infers variable types based on assigned values, and print both the values and their types using `fmt.Printf`.
