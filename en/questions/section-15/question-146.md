#### ❓ Question 146: Buffered vs unbuffered channels

Write a Go program that demonstrates the difference between buffered and unbuffered channels.

- Create an unbuffered channel and show how send/receive must synchronize.
- Create a buffered channel (e.g., buffer size 2) and show how values can be sent without immediate receive.
- Print output to illustrate the difference.

🔧 **Task:** Use both buffered and unbuffered channels to highlight their behavior in Go concurrency.
