#### ❓ Question 142: Launching a goroutine

Write a Go program that launches a goroutine to execute a function.

- Define a function that prints a message and sleeps for a short duration.
- Start this function as a goroutine from `main`.
- Print a message from `main` to show concurrent execution.
- Use `time.Sleep` in `main` to ensure the goroutine completes before the program exits.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate launching a goroutine and concurrent execution with `main`.
