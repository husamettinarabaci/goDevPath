Write a Go program that demonstrates the use of generics (type parameters) introduced in Go 1.18.

- Define a generic function that works with different types (e.g., a function that returns the first element of a slice).
- Show how to call this function with slices of different types (e.g., int, string).

🔧 **Task:** Implement and use a generic function with type parameters in Go.
