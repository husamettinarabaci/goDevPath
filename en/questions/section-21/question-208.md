#### ❓ Question 208: Using function types and callbacks

Write a Go program that demonstrates the use of function types and callbacks:

- Define a function type that takes two integers and returns an integer.
- Write a function that accepts this function type as a parameter (callback) and applies it to two integers.
- Show how to use this with different operations (e.g., addition, multiplication).

🔧 **Task:** Implement a callback mechanism using function types in Go, and demonstrate it with at least two different operations.
