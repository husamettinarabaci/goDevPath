#### ❓ Question 204: Using build tags

Write a Go program that demonstrates the use of build tags.

- Add a build tag at the top of the file to restrict compilation to a specific OS (e.g., linux or windows).
- Implement a simple function that prints a message indicating the OS.
- Optionally, create two files with different build tags for different OSes and show how to use them.

🔧 **Task:** Use build tags to control which files are included in the build for different operating systems.
