#### ❓ Question 68: Pointers to arrays and slices

Write a Go program that demonstrates pointers to arrays and slices:

- Declare an array of integers and create a pointer to the array.
- Modify the array using the pointer and print the result.
- Create a slice from the array and show how changes via the slice affect the array.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to use pointers with arrays and how slices provide reference semantics to the underlying array.
