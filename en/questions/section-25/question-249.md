#### ❓ Question 249: Building a microservice in Go

Write a Go program to implement a simple microservice.

- Expose a RESTful API (e.g., for managing items, users, or tasks) with endpoints for CRUD operations.
- Use Go's `net/http` package for the web server and routing.
- Store data in memory (map or slice) or use a lightweight database.
- Structure the code to separate handlers, models, and main logic for maintainability.
- Ensure proper error handling and input validation.

🔧 **Task:** Build a basic Go microservice with RESTful endpoints, in-memory or database storage, and clean code organization.
