#### ❓ Question 248: Building a simple database-backed app

Write a Go program to implement a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application backed by a database.

- Use SQLite (or another lightweight database) to store data (e.g., a list of tasks or notes).
- Implement HTTP handlers for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.
- Use Go's `database/sql` and `net/http` packages.
- Ensure proper error handling and input validation.

🔧 **Task:** Build a basic web application in Go that performs CRUD operations on a database and exposes them via HTTP endpoints.
