#### ❓ Question 246: Building a chat application

Write Go programs to implement a simple TCP-based chat application with a server and multiple clients.

- The server should accept multiple client connections and broadcast messages from any client to all connected clients.
- Each client should be able to send messages to the server and receive messages from other clients in real time.
- Use Go's `net` package and goroutines for concurrency.
- Ensure proper synchronization and error handling.

🔧 **Task:** Build a basic multi-client chat application in Go using TCP sockets, goroutines, and channels.
