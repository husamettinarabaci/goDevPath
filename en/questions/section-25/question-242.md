#### ❓ Question 242: Building a REST API in Go

Write a Go program that implements a simple REST API server.

- Use the `net/http` package to create an HTTP server.
- Define at least one endpoint (e.g., `/hello`) that returns a JSON response.
- Handle HTTP methods appropriately (e.g., GET).
- Marshal a Go struct to JSON for the response.

🔧 **Task:** Build a minimal REST API in Go that demonstrates endpoint creation and JSON response handling.
