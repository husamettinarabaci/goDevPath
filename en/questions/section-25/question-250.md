#### ❓ Question 250: Building and deploying a Go web application

Design, implement, and deploy a simple Go web application that demonstrates your understanding of the full Go development lifecycle:

- Create a Go web server that serves both static files and dynamic content (e.g., a simple blog, notes app, or task list).
- Use Go templates to render HTML pages.
- Organize your code into packages for maintainability.
- Add basic routing (e.g., home, about, and one dynamic page).
- Include a configuration file (JSON, YAML, or TOML) for environment-specific settings.
- Add logging for requests and errors.
- Write at least one test for a handler or core function.
- Build the application as a binary.
- Write a Dockerfile to containerize the app.
- Provide instructions for deploying the app (locally and with Docker).

🔧 **Task:** Build, test, and containerize a Go web application, then document the deployment process.
