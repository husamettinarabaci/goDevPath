#### ❓ Question 241: Building a CLI tool in Go

Write a Go program that implements a simple command-line interface (CLI) tool.

- Accept at least one command-line argument (e.g., a filename or a message).
- Print a help message if no arguments are provided.
- Perform a basic operation using the argument (e.g., print the file contents or echo the message).
- Use the `flag` package or `os.Args` for argument parsing.

🔧 **Task:** Build a minimal CLI tool in Go that demonstrates argument parsing and user feedback.
