#### ❓ Question 245: Building a TCP server and client

Write Go programs to implement both a TCP server and a TCP client.

- The server should listen on a specified port and accept incoming connections.
- When a client connects, the server should read messages from the client and echo them back.
- The client should connect to the server, send a message, and print the server's response.
- Use Go's `net` package for networking.
- Ensure proper error handling and resource cleanup.

🔧 **Task:** Build a simple TCP server and client in Go that communicate by sending and receiving messages.
