#### ❓ Question 187: Using the `io` and `io/ioutil` packages

Write a Go program that demonstrates reading the entire contents of a file and writing data to a file using the `io` and `io/ioutil` packages:

- Read all contents of a file named `input.txt` and print it to the terminal.
- Write the string `Hello, Go!` to a file named `output.txt`.

🔧 **Task:** Use `ioutil.ReadFile` (or `os.ReadFile` in Go 1.16+) and `ioutil.WriteFile` (or `os.WriteFile`) to perform file operations.
