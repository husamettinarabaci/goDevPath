#### ❓ Question 36: Reading input until EOF

Write a Go program that does the following:

- Continuously reads lines of input from the terminal until EOF (end-of-file) is reached (Ctrl+D on Linux/Mac, Ctrl+Z on Windows).
- Stores each line in a slice of strings.
- Prints all the lines after EOF is detected.

🔧 **Task:** Read multiple lines from the user until EOF, collect them, and display them at the end.
