#### ❓ Question 33: Handling input errors gracefully

Write a Go program that does the following:

- Reads user input from the terminal using `fmt.Scanln`.
- Attempts to parse the input as an integer.
- Handles any input or parsing errors gracefully by printing a user-friendly error message instead of crashing.

🔧 **Task:** Build a Go program that reads input, tries to convert it to an integer, and prints an error message if the input is invalid.
