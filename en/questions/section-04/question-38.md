#### ❓ Question 38: Reading and parsing a float

Write a Go program that does the following:

- Prompts the user to enter a floating-point number.
- Reads the input from the terminal (as a string).
- Parses the input into a `float64` value.
- Handles any parsing errors gracefully and prints a user-friendly error message if the input is invalid.

🔧 **Task:** Ask the user for a float, read and parse the input, and display the result or an error message.
