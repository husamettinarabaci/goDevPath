#### ❓ Question 40: Reading input from a file

Write a Go program that does the following:

- Reads the contents of a text file (e.g., `input.txt`).
- Prints each line of the file to the terminal.
- Handles file opening and reading errors gracefully.

🔧 **Task:** Open a file, read its contents line by line, and display each line. Print an error message if the file cannot be read.
