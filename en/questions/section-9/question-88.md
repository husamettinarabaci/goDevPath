#### ❓ Question 88: Slices and underlying arrays

Write a Go program that does the following:

- Declare and initialize an array of 5 integers.
- Create a slice from the array containing the 2nd to 4th elements.
- Modify the first element of the slice.
- Print both the original array and the slice to show how changes to the slice affect the underlying array.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate how slices share the same underlying array and how modifying a slice affects the array in Go.
