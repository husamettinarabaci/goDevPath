#### ❓ Question 90: Using the `len` and `cap` functions

Write a Go program that demonstrates the use of the `len` and `cap` functions:

- Declare an array and a slice.
- Print the length and capacity of both the array and the slice using `len` and `cap`.
- Show how the capacity of a slice changes when you append elements to it.

🔧 **Task:** Use `len` and `cap` to inspect the size and capacity of arrays and slices, and illustrate how slice capacity can grow dynamically.
