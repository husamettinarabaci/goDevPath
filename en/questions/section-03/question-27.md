#### ❓ Question 27: Using labels with `break` and `continue`

Write a Go program that demonstrates how to use labels with `break` and `continue` in nested loops.

- Create two nested `for` loops.
- Use a label to break out of both loops when a certain condition is met (e.g., when `i == 2` and `j == 3`).
- Use a label to continue the outer loop from the inner loop when a different condition is met (e.g., when `j == 1`).
- Print the values of `i` and `j` in each iteration.

🔧 **Task:** Use labeled `break` and `continue` statements to control the flow in nested loops.
