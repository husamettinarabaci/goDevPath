#### ❓ Question 80: Structs and JSON encoding/decoding

Write a Go program that demonstrates encoding and decoding a struct to and from JSON:

- Define a `Product` struct with `Name` (string) and `Price` (float64) fields.
- Create an instance of `Product` and encode it to JSON.
- Decode the JSON back into a struct and print the result.

🔧 **Task:** Use the `encoding/json` package to marshal and unmarshal a struct in Go.
