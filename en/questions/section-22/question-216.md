#### ❓ Question 216: Replacing modules in go.mod

Write a Go program and update your `go.mod` file to replace a dependency module with a local version.

- Create a simple Go module that imports a dependency (it can be a dummy or real module).
- Use the `replace` directive in `go.mod` to point the dependency to a local path instead of the remote version.
- Demonstrate that your code uses the local version of the dependency.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to use the `replace` directive in `go.mod` to override a module dependency with a local path.
