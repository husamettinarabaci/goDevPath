#### ❓ Question 212: Adding dependencies with `go get`

Write a step-by-step guide and a simple Go program that demonstrates how to add an external dependency using Go modules:

- Initialize a new Go module if you haven't already.
- Use the `go get` command to add a popular third-party package (e.g., `github.com/fatih/color`).
- Import and use the package in your `main.go` file (e.g., print colored text).
- Show how the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files are updated after adding the dependency.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate how to add and use an external package in a Go project using Go modules.
