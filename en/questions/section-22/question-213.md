#### ❓ Question 213: Upgrading and downgrading dependencies

Write a step-by-step guide and a simple Go program that demonstrates how to upgrade and downgrade a dependency in a Go module:

- Add a third-party dependency to your project (e.g., `github.com/fatih/color`).
- Use the `go get` command to upgrade the dependency to a newer version.
- Use the `go get` command to downgrade the dependency to an older version.
- Show how the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files change after each operation.
- Use the dependency in your `main.go` file to print colored text.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate how to manage dependency versions in a Go project using Go modules.
