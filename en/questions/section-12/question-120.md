#### ❓ Question 120: Interfaces and dynamic types

Write a Go program that does the following:

- Define an interface and multiple structs that implement it.
- Create a function that accepts the interface type and uses a type switch to determine the dynamic type at runtime.
- Demonstrate calling this function with different struct types and print a message based on the dynamic type.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to use a type switch to handle different dynamic types stored in an interface.
