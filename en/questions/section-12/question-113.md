#### ❓ Question 113: Interfaces and slices

Write a Go program that demonstrates how to use interfaces with slices.

- Define an interface and two or more struct types that implement it.
- Create a slice of the interface type.
- Add different struct instances to the slice.
- Iterate over the slice and call the interface method for each element.

🔧 **Task:** Show how a slice of interface type can hold different concrete types and how to use them polymorphically.
