#### ❓ Question 111: Embedding interfaces

Write a Go program that demonstrates how to embed interfaces.

- Define two interfaces, each with at least one method.
- Create a new interface that embeds both interfaces.
- Implement all methods in a struct type.
- Show how the struct satisfies the embedded interface and use it in a function.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate interface embedding and how a struct can implement multiple interfaces through embedding.
