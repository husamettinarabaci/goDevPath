#### ❓ Question 115: Interfaces and JSON encoding/decoding

Write a Go program that does the following:

- Define an interface (e.g., `Animal`) with at least one method.
- Create two or more structs that implement this interface (e.g., `Dog` and `Cat`).
- Create a slice of the interface type and add instances of the structs to it.
- Encode the slice to JSON and decode it back, handling the interface type correctly.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate how to encode and decode a slice of interface values to and from JSON in Go, ensuring type information is preserved.
