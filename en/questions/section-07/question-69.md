#### ❓ Question 69: Pointers to structs

Write a Go program that demonstrates pointers to structs:

- Define a struct type (e.g., `Person` with fields `name` and `age`).
- Create an instance of the struct and a pointer to it.
- Modify the struct fields using the pointer.
- Print the struct before and after modification.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to use pointers to access and modify struct fields in Go.
