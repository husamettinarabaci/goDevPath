#### ❓ Question 35: Reading a single character from input

Write a Go program that does the following:

- Prompts the user to enter a single character.
- Reads just one character from the terminal input (without requiring the user to press Enter, if possible).
- Prints the character that was entered.

🔧 **Task:** Ask the user for a character, read it, and display it. (Hint: Use `bufio.Reader` and `ReadByte` or `ReadRune` for character input.)
