#### ❓ Question 127: Exported vs unexported identifiers

Write a Go program that demonstrates the difference between exported and unexported identifiers in a package.

- Create a package with one exported variable (capitalized) and one unexported variable (lowercase).
- In your `main` package, import the custom package and try to access both variables.
- Observe which variable is accessible and which is not.

🔧 **Task:** Show how identifier capitalization controls visibility outside the package in Go.
