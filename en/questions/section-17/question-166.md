#### ❓ Question 166: Working with CSV files

Write a Go program that does the following:

- Defines a struct representing a product with `Name` and `Price` fields.
- Creates a slice of products and writes it as CSV to a file named `products.csv`.
- Reads the CSV file back and decodes it into a slice of products.
- Prints the decoded data to the terminal.

🔧 **Task:** Use the `encoding/csv` and `os` packages to write and read CSV data to and from a file in Go.
