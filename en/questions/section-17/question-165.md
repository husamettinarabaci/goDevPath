#### ❓ Question 165: Reading and writing JSON files

Write a Go program that does the following:

- Defines a struct representing a person with `Name` and `Age` fields.
- Creates a slice of people and writes it as JSON to a file named `people.json`.
- Reads the JSON file back and decodes it into a slice of people.
- Prints the decoded data to the terminal.

🔧 **Task:** Use the `encoding/json` and `os` packages to write and read JSON data to and from a file in Go.
