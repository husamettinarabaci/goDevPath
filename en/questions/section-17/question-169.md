#### ❓ Question 169: Walking a directory tree

Write a Go program that does the following:

- Recursively walks through a directory tree starting from the current directory (`.`).
- Prints the path of each file and directory found.
- Handles any errors that may occur during the walk and prints appropriate messages.

🔧 **Task:** Use the `filepath.Walk` or `filepath.WalkDir` function to traverse the directory tree and print each path.
