#### ❓ Question 163: Appending to a file

Write a Go program that does the following:

- Opens (or creates if it does not exist) a text file named `log.txt` for appending.
- Appends the string `New log entry` to the end of the file.
- Closes the file after writing.

🔧 **Task:** Use the `os` package with the appropriate file open flags to append text to a file in Go.
