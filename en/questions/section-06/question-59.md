#### ❓ Question 59: Panic and recover in functions

Write a Go function that demonstrates the use of `panic` and `recover`.

- Create a function that intentionally triggers a `panic`.
- Use `defer` and `recover` to handle the panic and print a custom error message.
- Show how the program continues running after recovering from a panic.

🔧 **Task:** Use `panic` and `recover` in a function to handle unexpected errors gracefully.
