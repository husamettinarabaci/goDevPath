#### ❓ Question 53: Introduction to anonymous functions

Write a Go program that demonstrates the use of an anonymous function:

- Define and immediately invoke an anonymous function that prints a message to the terminal.
- The anonymous function should not have a name and should be called right after its definition.
- Show the output in the terminal.

🔧 **Task:** Use an anonymous function to print a message without defining a named function.
