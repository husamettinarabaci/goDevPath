#### ❓ Question 55: Passing functions as arguments

Write a Go program that demonstrates passing a function as an argument:

- Define a function named `operate` that takes two integers and a function as parameters.
- The function parameter should accept two integers and return an integer.
- Call `operate` with different functions (e.g., addition and multiplication) and print the results.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to pass functions as arguments to other functions in Go.
