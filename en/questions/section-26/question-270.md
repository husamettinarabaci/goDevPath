#### ❓ Question 270: Using interfaces to achieve polymorphism

Write a Go program that demonstrates the following:

- Define an interface `Shape` with a method `Area() float64`.
- Define two structs, `Circle` and `Rectangle`, and implement the `Area` method for both.
- Write a function that takes a `Shape` interface and prints its area.
- Show usage with both `Circle` and `Rectangle` instances.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to use interfaces to achieve polymorphism in Go.
