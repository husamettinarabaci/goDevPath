#### ❓ Question 254: Struct embedding and inheritance-like behavior

Write a Go program that demonstrates the following:

- Define a struct named `Animal` with a field `Name` (string).
- Define another struct named `Dog` that embeds `Animal` and has an additional field `Breed` (string).
- Create an instance of `Dog`, assign values to all fields, and print them.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to use struct embedding to achieve inheritance-like behavior in Go.
