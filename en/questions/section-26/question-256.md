#### ❓ Question 256: Struct tags and reflection use

Write a Go program that demonstrates the following:

- Define a struct `User` with fields `ID` (int) and `Email` (string), and add JSON struct tags to both fields.
- Use the `encoding/json` package to marshal an instance of `User` to JSON.
- Use the `reflect` package to print the struct tags of the `User` fields.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to use struct tags for JSON and access them via reflection in Go.
