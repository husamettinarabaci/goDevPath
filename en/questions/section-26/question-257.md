#### ❓ Question 257: Factory functions for structs

Write a Go program that demonstrates the following:

- Define a struct named `Car` with fields `Brand` (string) and `Year` (int).
- Write a factory function `NewCar` that takes brand and year as parameters and returns a pointer to a `Car`.
- Create a new `Car` using the factory function and print its fields.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to use a factory function to create and initialize a struct in Go.
