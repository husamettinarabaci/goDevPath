#### ❓ Question 60: Functions as fields in structs

Write a Go program that demonstrates using a function as a field in a struct.

- Define a struct with a function field (e.g., a field of type `func(int, int) int`).
- Assign a function to this field and use it to perform an operation (such as addition or multiplication).
- Show how to call the function field from an instance of the struct.

🔧 **Task:** Create a struct with a function field and demonstrate assigning and calling a function through it.
