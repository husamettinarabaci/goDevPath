#### ❓ Question 58: Defer statements in functions

Write a Go function that demonstrates the use of the `defer` statement.

- Create a function that prints a message before and after a `defer` statement.
- Use `defer` to print a message that will execute after the function completes.
- Call this function from `main` to show the order of execution.

🔧 **Task:** Use the `defer` keyword to schedule a function call to run after the surrounding function returns.
