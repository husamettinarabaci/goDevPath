#### ❓ Question 56: Using closures in Go

Write a Go program that demonstrates the use of closures:

- Define a function named `makeCounter` that returns a function (closure).
- The returned function should increment and return an internal counter variable each time it is called.
- In `main`, create a counter and call it multiple times, printing the result each time.

🔧 **Task:** Show how closures can capture and modify variables from their surrounding scope.
