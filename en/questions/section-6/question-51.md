#### ❓ Question 51: Function scope and variable lifetime

Write a Go program that demonstrates function scope and variable lifetime:

- Declare a variable inside a function and show that it is not accessible outside that function.
- Print the value of the variable inside the function.
- Attempting to print the variable outside the function should result in a compile-time error (explain this in a comment).

🔧 **Task:** Illustrate how variable scope works in Go functions.
