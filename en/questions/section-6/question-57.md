#### ❓ Question 57: Recursion in Go functions

Write a Go program that demonstrates recursion:

- Define a function named `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer using recursion.
- The function should return 1 for 0, and for other values, return n * factorial(n-1).
- In `main`, call `factorial` with a sample value and print the result.

🔧 **Task:** Use recursion to calculate the factorial of a number in Go.
