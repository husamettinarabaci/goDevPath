#### ❓ Question 173: Testing error conditions

Write a Go program that does the following:

- Defines a function that divides two integers and returns an error if the divisor is zero.
- Writes a test function using the `testing` package to verify both successful division and error cases (e.g., division by zero).
- The test should check that the error is returned when expected and that the result is correct otherwise.

🔧 **Task:** Implement a division function with error handling and write tests for both normal and error scenarios using Go's `testing` package.
