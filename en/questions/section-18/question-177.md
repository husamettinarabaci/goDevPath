#### ❓ Question 177: Mocking in tests

Write a Go test that demonstrates how to use mocking to test code that depends on external resources or interfaces.

- Define an interface representing an external dependency (e.g., a database or API client).
- Create a mock implementation of the interface for testing purposes.
- Write a test function that uses the mock to verify the behavior of code under test.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to use a mock implementation to isolate and test code that interacts with external dependencies.
