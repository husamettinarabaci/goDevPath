#### ❓ Question 178: Testing concurrent code

Write a Go test that demonstrates how to test concurrent code.

- Implement a function that performs a task concurrently (e.g., using goroutines).
- Write a test that verifies the correctness of the concurrent function.
- Use synchronization primitives (such as `sync.WaitGroup` or channels) to ensure proper test behavior.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to write a test for a function that runs code concurrently, ensuring correctness and avoiding race conditions.
