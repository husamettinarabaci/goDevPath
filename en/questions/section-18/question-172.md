#### ❓ Question 172: Table-driven tests

Write a Go program that does the following:

- Defines a function that multiplies two integers.
- Writes a table-driven test using the `testing` package to verify the multiplication function with multiple test cases.
- Each test case should specify input values and the expected result. The test should iterate over the cases and report errors for any failures.

🔧 **Task:** Implement a multiplication function and a table-driven test for it using Go's `testing` package.
