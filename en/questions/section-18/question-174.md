#### ❓ Question 174: Using test coverage tools

Write a Go program and demonstrate how to measure test coverage:

- Create a simple function (e.g., subtract two integers) and write a test for it using the `testing` package.
- Show how to run the tests and measure code coverage using the `go test -cover` command.
- Briefly explain the output and what coverage percentage means.

🔧 **Task:** Implement a function and its test, and describe how to use Go's test coverage tools to measure coverage.
