#### ❓ Question 74: Struct embedding (composition)

Write a Go program that demonstrates struct embedding (composition):

- Define a `Person` struct with fields for `name` and `age`.
- Define an `Employee` struct that embeds `Person` and adds a `position` field.
- Create an instance of `Employee` and print all its fields.

🔧 **Task:** Use struct embedding to compose a new struct from existing ones and show how to access embedded fields.
