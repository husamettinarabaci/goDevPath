#### ❓ Question 76: Structs with pointer fields

Write a Go program that demonstrates structs with pointer fields:

- Define a `Book` struct with a `title` field (string) and a pointer field `author` (pointer to string).
- Create an instance of `Book`, assign values, and print the book's title and author.

🔧 **Task:** Use a pointer field in a struct to reference data and show how to access the value it points to.
