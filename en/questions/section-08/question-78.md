#### ❓ Question 78: Structs and zero values

Write a Go program that demonstrates the zero values of struct fields:

- Define a `User` struct with `name` (string) and `age` (int) fields.
- Create a variable of type `User` without initializing its fields.
- Print the values of the struct fields to show their zero values.

🔧 **Task:** Show what values struct fields have by default when not explicitly initialized in Go.
