#### ❓ Question 29: Using `fallthrough` in switch statements

Write a Go program that demonstrates how to use the `fallthrough` statement in a `switch` block.

- Create a variable with an integer value.
- Use a `switch` statement to check the value.
- In one of the cases, use the `fallthrough` statement to continue to the next case block.
- Print a message for each case to show the effect of `fallthrough`.

🔧 **Task:** Use the `fallthrough` statement in a `switch` block to execute the next case.
