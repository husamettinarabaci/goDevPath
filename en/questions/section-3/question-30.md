#### ❓ Question 30: Using `goto` in Go

Write a Go program that demonstrates how to use the `goto` statement to jump to a labeled statement.

- Create a loop that prints numbers from 1 to 5.
- Use the `goto` statement to exit the loop early when the number is 3, jumping to a label after the loop.
- Print a message after the label to show the jump occurred.

🔧 **Task:** Use the `goto` statement and a label to control the flow of your program.
