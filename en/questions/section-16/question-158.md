Write a Go program that demonstrates both a deadlock and a race condition.

- Create a scenario where two goroutines cause a race condition (e.g., by updating a shared variable without synchronization).
- Briefly explain how each issue occurs in your code comments.
- Optionally, show how to fix each issue.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate and explain both a deadlock and a race condition in Go.
