#### ❓ Question 200: Error handling in HTTP servers

Write a Go HTTP server that demonstrates robust error handling:

- Set up an HTTP server with at least one route.
- Intentionally trigger an error (e.g., by accessing a non-existent resource or simulating a server error).
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages to the client.
- Log the error on the server side for debugging purposes.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to handle errors gracefully in an HTTP server, including sending correct status codes and logging errors.
