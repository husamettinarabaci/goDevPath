#### ❓ Question 195: Handling routes in HTTP server

Write a Go program that does the following:

- Starts an HTTP server on port 8080.
- Handles requests to `/` by responding with "Welcome!".
- Handles requests to `/about` by responding with "About Page".
- Prints a message to the terminal when the server starts.

🔧 **Task:** Use the `net/http` package to handle multiple routes in an HTTP server.
