#### ❓ Question 197: Using URL parameters

Write a Go program that does the following:

- Starts an HTTP server on port 8080.
- Handles requests to `/greet?name=YourName` and responds with `Hello, YourName!`.
- If the `name` parameter is missing, respond with `Hello, Guest!`.
- Prints a message to the terminal when the server starts.

🔧 **Task:** Use the `net/http` package to read URL query parameters and respond accordingly.
