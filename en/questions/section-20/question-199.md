#### ❓ Question 199: Using WebSockets in Go

Write a Go program that does the following:

- Starts an HTTP server on port 8080.
- Upgrades HTTP connections to WebSocket connections at the `/ws` endpoint.
- Echoes back any message received from the client.
- Prints a message to the terminal when the server starts.

🔧 **Task:** Use the `github.com/gorilla/websocket` package to implement a simple WebSocket echo server.
