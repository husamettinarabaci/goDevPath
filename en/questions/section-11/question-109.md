#### ❓ Question 109: Type switches with interfaces

Write a Go program that demonstrates how to use a type switch with interfaces.

- Define an interface and multiple struct types that implement it.
- Assign different struct instances to a variable of the interface type.
- Write a function that uses a type switch to determine the concrete type held by the interface and prints a message accordingly.
- Call this function with different interface values in `main`.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to use a type switch to handle multiple concrete types stored in an interface value.
