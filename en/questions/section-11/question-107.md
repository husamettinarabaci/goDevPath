#### ❓ Question 107: Using interface values

Write a Go program that demonstrates how to use interface values.

- Define an interface with at least one method.
- Create two different struct types that implement this interface.
- Write a function that accepts the interface type and calls its method.
- In `main`, assign different struct instances to a variable of the interface type and call the function.

🔧 **Task:** Show how interface values can hold different concrete types and how to use them in functions.
