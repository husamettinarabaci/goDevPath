#### âœ… Answer 227: Using `golint` and static analysis tools

`golint` checks Go code for style mistakes and suggests improvements. Other static analysis tools like `go vet` and `staticcheck` help find bugs and code issues.

Example usage:

```bash
go install golang.org/x/lint/golint@latest
golint ./...
go vet ./...
go install honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck@latest
staticcheck ./...
```

- `golint ./...` checks all Go files for style issues.
- `go vet ./...` performs advanced static analysis.
- `staticcheck ./...` finds bugs and code smells.

Using these tools regularly helps maintain high code quality.
