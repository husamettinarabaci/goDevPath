#### âœ… Answer 225: Using `go generate`

The `go generate` tool runs commands described by special `//go:generate` comments in your Go source files. It's commonly used for code generation or asset embedding.

Example:

```go
//go:generate echo "Generating code..."
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Go generate!")
}
```

To run the directive, use:

```bash
go generate
```

This will execute the command in the `//go:generate` comment. In real projects, it's often used with tools like `stringer`, `mockgen`, or asset generators.
