Structs in Go can have fields that are pointers, allowing you to reference data stored elsewhere. This is useful for sharing or updating data without copying it.

```go
package main
import "fmt"

type Book struct {
    title  string
    author *string
}

func main() {
    authorName := "John Doe"
    b := Book{
        title:  "Go in Action",
        author: &authorName,
    }
    fmt.Println("Title:", b.title)
    fmt.Println("Author:", *b.author)
}
```
