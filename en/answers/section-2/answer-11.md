#### âœ… Answer 11: Defining and initializing variables

In Go, you can define variables using the `var` keyword and initialize them with a value. Here is an example that declares an integer and a string variable, assigns values, and prints them:

```go
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
    var age int = 25
    var name string = "Alice"
    fmt.Println("Name:", name)
    fmt.Println("Age:", age)
}
```

This program demonstrates variable declaration, initialization, and printing their values.
