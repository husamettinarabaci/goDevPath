#### âœ… Answer 220: Best practices for dependency management

Best practices for Go module dependency management:

- **Add dependencies only as needed:** Use `go get` to add required modules, and avoid unnecessary dependencies.
- **Keep dependencies tidy:** Run `go mod tidy` regularly to remove unused dependencies and ensure `go.mod` and `go.sum` are up to date.
- **Vendor dependencies for reproducible builds:** Use `go mod vendor` if you need to ensure all dependencies are available locally (e.g., for CI or offline builds).
- **Use semantic versioning:** Prefer stable, tagged releases for dependencies.
- **Review dependency updates:** Check changelogs and test your code after updating dependencies.
- **Pin versions:** Avoid using pseudo-versions or untagged commits in production.
- **Check for vulnerabilities:** Use tools like `govulncheck` to scan dependencies.
- **Common pitfalls:** Avoid direct editing of `go.mod` unless necessary, and don't commit unnecessary dependencies.

Following these practices helps keep your Go projects stable, secure, and maintainable.
