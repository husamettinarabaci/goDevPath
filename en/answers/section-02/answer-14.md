#### âœ… Answer 14: Using basic numeric types (int, float64, etc.)

Go provides several basic numeric types, such as `int` for integers and `float64` for floating-point numbers. Here is an example:

```go
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
    var count int = 42
    var price float64 = 19.99
    fmt.Println("Count:", count)
    fmt.Println("Price:", price)
}
```

This program demonstrates declaring and using `int` and `float64` variables, and printing their values.
