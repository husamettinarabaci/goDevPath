Go supports multiline comments using `/* ... */`. These comments can span multiple lines and are often used for documentation or to temporarily disable code blocks.

```go
/*
This is a multiline comment in Go.
It can span several lines and is ignored by the compiler.
*/
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Multiline comment example.")
}
```
