# üêπ Go Full Mastery Path

## 1. `goBasics`
**Foundations: Syntax, Variables, Functions, Types, and Control Flow**  
Learn the core of the Go language: short variable declarations, functions, for-loops, type conversion, zero values, and idiomatic code structure.

## 2. `goPractitioner`
**Intermediate Go: Structs, Interfaces, Error Handling, JSON, Modules**  
Understand Go's key building blocks: use interfaces for abstraction, manage errors, handle JSON and file I/O, organize projects with modules, and use the standard library effectively.

## 3. `goApplied`
**Applied Go: Web Servers, CLI Tools, gRPC, Game Dev, Embedded, Plugins**  
Apply Go in practical scenarios: build RESTful APIs, develop command-line tools with Cobra, create games with Ebiten, write gRPC services, run Go on microcontrollers, and implement plugin systems.

## 4. `goInternals`
**Deep Go: Memory Model, Escape Analysis, Reflection, Unsafe, Build Tags**  
Understand Go‚Äôs inner workings: analyze memory allocations, leverage reflection, explore unsafe operations, use build constraints, and inspect runtime behavior.

## 5. `goConcurrency`
**Concurrency Mastery: Channels, Goroutines, Fan-In/Fan-Out, Timeout Patterns**  
Master Go‚Äôs concurrency paradigm: coordinate goroutines using channels, implement fan-in/fan-out patterns, handle timeouts, avoid deadlocks, and detect race conditions.

## 6. `goArchitecture`
**Architectural Go: Microservices, Monoliths, Event-Driven Systems, Pipelines**  
Design robust applications: build scalable microservices, monolithic apps with layered structure, event-driven communication, data streaming pipelines, and cross-service observability.
